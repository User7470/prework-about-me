      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm just a part-time worker/student looking for a starting point towards a successful career</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Painesville, Ohio</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I mostly just play videogames or enjoy discussing various aspects of said games online.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I wouldn't say I have a real dream job of any sort, I'd be content with almost any job where I can simply perform well so long as I don't actively hate said job.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Painesville, Ohio</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I figured that there was a good job market for coding and that it wouldn't be a field that I would dislike or get tired of working in</p>
